Step1:
1. Download Oracle Database:
Visit the official Oracle Database download page: Oracle Database Downloads.
Download the Oracle Database installer appropriate for your operating system.

Step 2: Create Tables and Import Data
1. Create Tables:
Open a SQL tool (SQLcl, SQL*Plus, or SQL Developer) connected to your Oracle Database.
Run SQL commands to create tables that match the structure of your CSV files.

2. Import Data:
Use Oracle SQL*Loader or other tools to import data from your CSV files into the tables.
For SQL*Loader, create a control file specifying the format and mapping between CSV columns and 
Oracle table columns.
Example ------------
CREATE TABLE Dataset_Purchases (
    City VARCHAR2(50),
    CustomerID NUMBER,
    TotalAmount NUMBER
    -- Add other columns as needed
);

CREATE TABLE Dataset_Cities (
    City VARCHAR2(50),
    Population NUMBER,
    "Average Monthly Salary (USD)" NUMBER,
    "Financial Situation" VARCHAR2(50)
    -- Add other columns as needed
);
---------

Step 3: Install Oracle SQL Client
1. Download SQLcl or SQL Developer:
Oracle SQLcl is a command-line interface.
Oracle SQL Developer is a graphical tool.

2. Install SQL Client:
Follow the installation instructions provided for the chosen SQL client.

------------

Step 4: Connect to Oracle Database
1. Open SQL Client:
Launch SQLcl or SQL Developer.

2.Connect to Database:
Enter the connection details such as hostname, port, service name, username, and password.
Connect to your Oracle Database.

------------

Step 5: Execute SQL Queries
1. Open Query Editor:
In SQLcl, use the command-line interface.
In SQL Developer, open a SQL Worksheet.
2. Paste and Execute Queries:
Copy and paste your SQL queries into the query editor.
Example
-- Example: Percentage Buying
SELECT
    p.City,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.CustomerID) * 100.0 / c.Population AS PercentageBuying
FROM
    Dataset_Purchases p
JOIN
    Dataset_Cities c ON p.City = c.City
GROUP BY
    p.City, c.Population;
